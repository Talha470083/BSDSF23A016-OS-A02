## üìò LS Assignment ‚Äî Conceptual Questions and Answers

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the crucial difference between the `stat()` and `lstat()` system calls? In the context of the `ls` command, when is it more appropriate to use `lstat()`?
**Answer:**  
The key difference is that `stat()` follows symbolic links, while `lstat()` does not.  
- `stat()` retrieves information about the **target file** the link points to.  
- `lstat()` retrieves information about the **link itself**.  
üìå In the context of the `ls` command, `lstat()` is more appropriate because `ls` needs to display properties of the symbolic link itself (like its name and target), not just the file it points to.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The `st_mode` field in `struct stat` contains both the file type and permission bits. Explain how you can use bitwise operators (like `&`) and predefined macros (like `S_IFDIR` or `S_IRUSR`) to extract this information.
**Answer:**  
You can use bitwise AND (`&`) along with macros to check specific bits in `st_mode`.  
Example:
```c
if (st.st_mode & S_IFDIR)   // Check if it's a directory
    printf("Directory\n");

if (st.st_mode & S_IRUSR)   // Check if owner can read
    printf("Readable by owner\n");
```
Each macro corresponds to a specific bitmask defined in `<sys/stat.h>` for file types or permissions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the general logic for printing items in a "down then across" columnar format. Why is a simple single loop through the list of filenames insufficient for this task?
**Answer:**  
In ‚Äúdown then across‚Äù format, filenames fill vertically first, then move horizontally across columns.  
You must:
- Calculate the **number of rows and columns** based on terminal width and longest filename.
- Use **two nested loops** or index math to print vertically by column.

A single loop is insufficient because it prints filenames linearly (left to right), whereas ‚Äúdown then across‚Äù requires multi-dimensional indexing to simulate column-based layout.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of the `ioctl` system call in this context? What would be the limitations of your program if you only used a fixed-width fallback (e.g., 80 columns) instead of detecting the terminal size?
**Answer:**  
`ioctl()` with `TIOCGWINSZ` retrieves the terminal window size dynamically.  
This allows your program to adapt column width and layout to fit the user‚Äôs screen.  
If you used a fixed width (like 80 columns), output could:
- Appear misaligned on wider or narrower terminals.
- Truncate filenames.
- Fail to use available space efficiently.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Compare the implementation complexity of the "down then across" (vertical) printing logic versus the "across" (horizontal) printing logic. Which one requires more pre-calculation and why?
**Answer:**  
The ‚Äúdown then across‚Äù logic is more complex because it requires:
- Pre-calculating number of rows and columns.
- Determining index mapping for vertical traversal.
- Computing column width based on filename lengths.

The ‚Äúacross‚Äù (horizontal) logic simply iterates linearly through filenames and prints them in sequence, so it needs much less pre-calculation.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Describe the strategy you used in your code to manage the different display modes (`-l`, `-x`, and default). How did your program decide which function to call for printing?
**Answer:**  
A **mode flag system** was used to select the output format based on user options:
```c
if (flag_long)
    print_long_format(files);
else if (flag_horizontal)
    print_horizontal(files);
else
    print_default(files);
```
This modular design ensures clarity and makes it easy to extend functionality by adding new print functions.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Why is it necessary to read all directory entries into memory before you can sort them? What are the potential drawbacks of this approach for directories containing millions of files?
**Answer:**  
Sorting requires random access to the entire dataset, so all directory entries must be stored first.  
**Drawbacks:**  
- High memory usage for large directories.  
- Increased I/O time.  
- Potential slowdowns or memory exhaustion if there are millions of files.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the purpose and signature of the comparison function required by `qsort()`. How does it work, and why must it take `const void *` arguments?
**Answer:**  
`qsort()` is a generic sorting function, so its comparator must accept generic pointers:
```c
int compare(const void *a, const void *b);
```
You cast them to the appropriate type inside:
```c
int compare_names(const void *a, const void *b) {
    const char *sa = *(const char **)a;
    const char *sb = *(const char **)b;
    return strcmp(sa, sb);
}
```
The `const void *` ensures type safety and allows `qsort()` to sort arrays of any data type.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ How do ANSI escape codes work to produce color in a standard Linux terminal? Show the specific code sequence for printing text in green.
**Answer:**  
ANSI escape codes are sequences that modify text appearance.  
They start with `\033[` and end with `m`.  
Example for **green text**:
```c
printf("\033[0;32mThis text is green!\033[0m\n");
```
- `\033[0;32m` ‚Üí Begin green text  
- `\033[0m` ‚Üí Reset to default color

### üîü To color an executable file, you need to check its permission bits. Explain which bits in the `st_mode` field you need to check to determine if a file is executable by the owner, group, or others.
**Answer:**  
You check the **execute permission bits** in `st_mode`:
```c
if (st.st_mode & (S_IXUSR | S_IXGRP | S_IXOTH))
    printf("Executable file\n");
```
- `S_IXUSR`: Executable by owner  
- `S_IXGRP`: Executable by group  
- `S_IXOTH`: Executable by others  
If any of these bits are set, the file is considered executable.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ In a recursive function, what is a "base case"? In the context of your recursive `ls`, what is the base case that stops the recursion from continuing forever?
**Answer:**  
A **base case** is a stopping condition that prevents infinite recursion.  
In `recursive ls`, the base case occurs when:
- A directory has no subdirectories.
- The directory cannot be opened (e.g., permission denied).
Without a base case, the recursion would continue endlessly and crash the program.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Explain why it is essential to construct a full path (e.g., `"parent_dir/subdir"`) before making a recursive call. What would happen if you simply called `do_ls("subdir")` from within `do_ls("parent_dir")`?
**Answer:**  
It‚Äôs essential because system calls like `opendir()` and `stat()` require the **correct relative or absolute path** to locate files.  
If you only pass `"subdir"`, the program looks in the **current working directory**, not inside `"parent_dir"`.  
This would cause:
- Wrong file paths.  
- Errors opening subdirectories.  
- Incorrect or incomplete recursion behavior.
